short_description: Toy Pad emulator for Lego Dimensions via USB
description: |
  Use your Flipper as a ToyPad!
  This app emulates the behavior of the original USB ToyPad.
  Allowing you to place characters, vehicles all directly from your Flipper!

  **Favorite minifigs** and **save vehicles (including upgrades)** for quick access later.  
  Hold the **OK** button on a character or vehicle in the emulation screen to do this.

  Enable _Quick Minifig Switching_ to quickly move a minifig to a new position by placing a new one.
  _Note: While this setting is on, it disables placing multiple copies of the same minifig on the ToyPad._

  **Compatibility:**
  Works with **PS5, PS4, PS3, and Wii U**.
  _Xbox is not available yet._
