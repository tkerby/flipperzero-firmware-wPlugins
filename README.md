**Mystic Balloon** is an atmospheric 2D platformer featuring **39 levels**, each requiring precision, careful planning, and attention to detail.

The player controls a character who navigates the levels using **balloons**. The hero can **slowly descend while suspended by balloons** and **float above air currents created by fans**, using them to cross gaps and reach hard-to-access areas. At the start of each level, the character has **3 balloons**, which are essential for survival.

### Player objectives:

* Complete the level while **keeping as many balloons as possible**
* **Collect all the coins** in the level
* Avoid traps and dangerous obstacles

Every mistake may cost a balloon, so it’s important to think ahead and use the game’s physics to your advantage.

The game features a **save system** that stores unlocked levels and scores, allowing players to continue their progress at any time and aim for better results.

**Mystic Balloon** combines simple controls, gradually increasing difficulty, and tactical gameplay that rewards careful and thoughtful play.

This project is a **fork** of the original [Mystic Balloon](https://github.com/Team-ARG-Museum/ID-34-Mystic-Balloon/) project. The main goal of this fork is to port the game from the Arduboy console to **Flipper Zero**.
