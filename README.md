# **ProtoPirate**

### _for Flipper Zero_

ProtoPirate is an experimental rolling-code analysis toolkit developed by members of **The Pirates' Plunder**.
The app currently supports decoding for multiple automotive key-fob families (Kia, Ford, Subaru, Suzuki, VW, and more), with the goal of being a drop-in Flipper app (.fap) that is free, open source, and can be used on any Flipper Zero firmware.

## **Supported Protocols**

Decoders:

- KIA V0
- KIA V1
- KIA V2
- KIA V3 / V4
- KIA V5
- KIA V6
- Fiat
- Ford V0
- Scher-Khan
- StarLine
- Subaru
- Suzuki
- Volkswagen (VW)

Encoders:

- Ford V0
- KIA V0
- KIA V1
- KIA V2
- StarLine
- More Coming Soon

## **Features**

### 📡 Protocol Receiver

Real-time signal capture and decoding with animated radar display. Supports frequency hopping.

### 📂 Sub Decode

Load and analyze existing `.sub` files from your SD card. Browse `/ext/subghz/` to decode previously captured signals.

### ⏱️ Timing Tuner

Tool for protocol developers to compare real fob signal timing against protocol definitions.

- **Protocol Definition**: Expected short/long pulse durations and tolerance
- **Received Signal**: Measured timing from real fob (avg, min, max, sample count)
- **Analysis**: Difference from expected, jitter measurements
- **Conclusion**: Whether timing matches or needs adjustment with specific recommendations
