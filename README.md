# Flippper Amiibo Toolkit

An Amiibo toolkit app for Flipper Zero.

This project is in early development. Features may be incomplete or unstable.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the Flipper Zero community and developers for their continuous support and inspiration.
- The data used in this project comes from AmiiboAPI (https://amiiboapi.com/).
- The algorighms and methods for Amiibo data manipulation are based on research and contributions from various online communities dedicated to Amiibo reverse engineering. Including but not limited to:
  * [Reverse Engineering Nintendo Amiibo (NFC Toy)](https://kevinbrewster.github.io/Amiibo-Reverse-Engineering/), containing a very detailed analysis of the Amiibo data structure.
  * [amiitool](https://github.com/socram8888/amiitool), a command-line tool for manipulating Amiibo data.
  * [weebo](https://github.com/bettse/weebo), another flipper zero amiibo tool, which uses amiitool, confirming (for me personally) that the flipper zero can handle the cryptography involved in Amiibo data manipulation.
