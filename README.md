### FlipperPwn (USB + GPIO)
Modular pentest payload framework with OS detection, inspired by Metasploit. Supports USB HID keystroke injection and WiFi Dev Board (ESP32 Marauder) via GPIO UART.

- **Module Categories**: Recon, Credentials, Exploit, and Post-Exploit modules loaded from `.fpwn` files on the SD card
- **OS Detection**: Automatic host OS fingerprinting via USB HID LED heuristics (NumLock/ScrollLock probes distinguish Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- **Cross-Platform Payloads**: Each `.fpwn` module can contain platform-specific payload sections (`PLATFORM WIN`, `PLATFORM MAC`, `PLATFORM LINUX`) with DuckyScript-like syntax
- **Template Substitution**: Configurable options via `OPTION` declarations with `{{OPTION_NAME}}` placeholders substituted at runtime
- **WiFi Dev Board Integration**: Connect an ESP32 WiFi Dev Board (running Marauder firmware) to the Flipper's GPIO header for wireless capabilities:
  - WiFi AP scanning with RSSI, channel, and encryption display
  - Network joining (WPA/WPA2/Open)
  - ICMP ping sweep for host discovery
  - Port scanning with service identification
  - Deauth attacks and PMKID sniffing

- **Live Execution View**: Real-time progress display with line count and abort support (press Back to abort)

**Module files**: Copy `flipperpwn_modules/` contents to `/ext/flipperpwn/modules/` on the SD card.

### SubGHz Spectrum (Sub-GHz)
Real-time Sub-GHz spectrum analyzer.

- **4 Frequency Bands**: 315 MHz (310-320), 433 MHz (425-445), 868 MHz (860-880), 915 MHz (900-930)
- **Bar & Waterfall Views**: Toggle between bar graph and waterfall display in Settings
- **Adjustable Step Size**: 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 / 200 kHz
- **Peak Hold**: Optional peak marker overlay
- **CSV Logging**: Scan data exported to `/ext/subghz_spectrum/` with timestamps

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) running official firmware
- [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) (micro Flipper Build Tool) installed on your computer
- Python 3.8+ (required by ufbt)

### Install ufbt

```bash
pip install ufbt
```

Or if you prefer pipx:

```bash
pipx install ufbt
```

### Build All Apps

Clone this repository and build each application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barkandbite/flipper_suite.git
cd flipper_suite

# Build each app individually
for app in badusb_pro ccid_emulator flipperpwn hid_exfil nfc_fuzzer spi_flash_dump subghz_spectrum; do
    cd "$app"
    ufbt
    cd ..
done
```

Each app builds to `<app_name>/dist/<app_name>.fap`.

### Install to Flipper Zero

Connect your Flipper Zero via USB, then deploy each app:

```bash
cd badusb_pro
ufbt launch     # Builds, installs, and launches on Flipper
cd ..
```

Or manually copy the `.fap` files:

1. Build the app with `ufbt` (inside the app directory)
2. Copy `dist/<app_name>.fap` to your Flipper's SD card under `/ext/apps/<category>/`
   - BadUSB Pro, CCID Emulator, HID Exfil: `/ext/apps/USB/`
   - FlipperPwn: `/ext/apps/Tools/`
   - NFC Fuzzer: `/ext/apps/NFC/`
   - SPI Flash Dump: `/ext/apps/GPIO/`
   - SubGHz Spectrum: `/ext/apps/Sub-GHz/`

## FAQ

**Q: What firmware version do I need?**
A: These apps are built against the official Flipper Zero firmware SDK. They were developed and tested with API version 87.1 (firmware 1.4.x). If you're on a significantly older or newer firmware, rebuild from source with `ufbt` to match your version.

**Q: Do these work with custom firmware (Momentum, Unleashed, etc.)?**
A: They may work if the custom firmware maintains API compatibility with the official SDK. Rebuild from source with `ufbt` pointed at your firmware's SDK for best results. No guarantees are made for third-party firmware.

**Q: How do I update ufbt's SDK version?**
A: Run `ufbt update` to pull the latest SDK matching your Flipper's firmware. If you need a specific version: `ufbt update --channel=release`.

**Q: The app crashes or shows "API mismatch" on my Flipper.**
A: This means the `.fap` was built against a different firmware version than what's running on your Flipper. Rebuild from source: `cd <app_directory> && ufbt`.

**Q: Can I use BadUSB Pro over Bluetooth?**
A: BLE HID is not currently available in the official firmware SDK for external FAP applications. The app will automatically fall back to USB mode. This may change in future firmware releases.

**Q: Where does SPI Flash Dump save files?**
A: Dumps are saved to `/ext/apps_data/spi_flash_dump/` on the SD card, named by the detected chip and timestamp.

**Q: Can I add my own CCID card profiles?**
A: Yes. Create a `.ccid` file following the format in the sample cards and place it in `/ext/apps_data/ccid_emulator/cards/` on your SD card. The format uses `[Card]` headers with `AID`, `RULE`, and `DEFAULT_RESPONSE` directives.

**Q: How do I add custom FlipperPwn modules?**
A: Create a `.fpwn` text file with `NAME`, `DESCRIPTION`, `CATEGORY`, and `PLATFORMS` headers, then add `OPTION` declarations and `PLATFORM WIN`/`PLATFORM MAC`/`PLATFORM LINUX` sections with DuckyScript-like commands. Place the file in `/ext/flipperpwn/modules/` on the SD card. See the included modules in `flipperpwn_modules/` for examples.

**Q: Does FlipperPwn require admin/root on the target?**
A: Most modules operate at user privilege level. Modules like UAC bypass use techniques (e.g., fodhelper.exe) that escalate without a UAC prompt on default Windows settings. Modules that require elevated access are noted in their descriptions.

**Q: What SPI flash chips are supported?**
A: The app includes a database of 32 common SPI NOR flash chips and will auto-detect via JEDEC ID. If your chip isn't recognized, the app will display the raw JEDEC ID so you can verify compatibility manually.
