# FlipperZero_NFC_Comparator
This is a simple tool to compare a stored NFC card against a physical card using a Flipper Zero device as of the moment it just checks the UID, UID length and protocol but i would like to add support for checking more variables to confirm how similar the NFC cards are.

I started working on this project as i use blank NFC card with no distinguishing characteristics and needed a way to check what card had been written with what data.
## Feedback:
Any feedback is welcome and would be very much appreciated as it helps me to improve and build upon the project
