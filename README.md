# Elementis Zeta

A creature-collecting RPG for the **Flipper Zero**. Explore towns, routes, caves and gyms, catch and train original creatures, win eight medals and take on the League. The 1-bit screen shows **four gray levels** through a fast temporal flicker.

Creatures, map, characters and music are all original and were made for this game.

## Features

- Nine chapters, from the first village to the League and the post-game; eight medals; Hall of Legacy and credits.
- 150+ original creatures ("Elementis"), turn-based battles with trainers and wild creatures, items, status effects, evolutions, a PC box, a Registro of seen and caught creatures, a trainer card, a casino and save / continue.
- Four languages: Spanish, English, Japanese and Simplified Chinese. Pick one on the first launch (the list starts on English); change it any time in Options.
- 70+ music tracks and sound effects on the speaker, with an Off switch.
- Experimental: trade creatures (including trade evolutions) and fight exhibition battles between two Flippers over the infrared port, face to face.
- Seven loadable plugins (`ez_*.fal`) keep the RAM use low enough for the Flipper; the whole game is one `.fap`.

## Controls

## Requirements

- Flipper Zero, official firmware **1.5.1** (API 88). Momentum and Unleashed work with their own build (see "API rule").
- A healthy microSD card (A1, 16 to 32 GB). An old or failing card makes the game freeze.
- The game uses most of the Flipper's RAM: close other apps first.
- The first launch unpacks about 5 MB of assets to `/ext/apps_assets/elementis_zeta`. This takes **over a minute**: do not power off or restart the Flipper meanwhile. Saves go to `/ext/apps_data/elementis_zeta`; the game saves only when you choose Save.

## Install

- From the **Flipper Apps Catalog** (Flipper Lab or the mobile app), once it is listed; or
- copy a release `elementis_zeta.fap` to `apps/Games/` on the SD card; or
- build it yourself (below).

## Build

You need [ufbt](https://pypi.org/project/ufbt/) and the SDK of the firmware your Flipper runs. The generated game data is committed (`nucleo/files/`, `nucleo/gen/`), so building the app needs no Python.

```
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt   # once: ufbt and Pillow
.venv/bin/ufbt update --channel=release                               # once: SDK of the official release firmware
cd nucleo
../.venv/bin/ufbt                  # builds elementis_zeta.fap and the seven ez_*.fal plugins into ~/.ufbt/build/
../.venv/bin/ufbt launch           # installs and starts it on a Flipper connected by USB (close qFlipper first)
```

`NUCLEO_DEBUG=1 ufbt` builds the development version (debug overlay and key combos); a normal `ufbt` is the release build players run. To use a separate SDK folder, set `UFBT_HOME=/some/dir` before the commands.

**API rule.** A `.fap` loads only on a firmware with the same API major and an equal-or-newer API minor, so always build with the SDK that matches the device's firmware (`ufbt update --channel=release`, or `--index-url=...` for Momentum / Unleashed).

### Rebuild the game data (optional)

The art, maps, texts, music and data tables are the sources in `assets/` and `maps/`; `tools/build_assets.sh` turns them into `nucleo/files/` and `nucleo/gen/` and runs the checks of every converter. It needs Python 3.11 or newer, Pillow and a C compiler (`cc`):

```
NO_UFBT=1 bash tools/build_assets.sh        # the content pipeline and its checks
```

Without `NO_UFBT=1` the script finishes with `tools/mem_budget.sh` (builds both variants with `ufbt` and checks the RAM budgets; it needs the SDK as above). Many comments in the source mention "contract N": those are section numbers of the author's private engineering notes, which are not published.
