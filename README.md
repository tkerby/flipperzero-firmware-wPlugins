# BzzBzz - Rhythm-Matching Game for Flipper Zero

![Startscreen](https://github.com/ikiruneo/BzzBzz/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot1.png?raw=true "Startscreen")

Haptic rhythm-matching game focusing on tactile feedback rather than visual cues.

  - The app generates a 5-step vibration sequence.
  - Gaps between vibrations are randomized between 200, 500, and 800ms.
  - Users must replicate the timing using any navigation key or the OK button.
  - Accuracy is calculated based on timing offsets; a >60% threshold is required to progress.
  - Patterns auto-repeat after 5 seconds of inactivity.
