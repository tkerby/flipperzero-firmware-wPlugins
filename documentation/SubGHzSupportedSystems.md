# Sub-GHz Supported Protocols

This file lists all supported Sub-GHz protocols available in RM Firmware (thanks to Unleashed), both tested and untested.

That list is only for default SubGHz app, apps like *Weather Station* have their own protocols list


## Static & Dynamic protocols list

*433 MHz usually means `433.92MHz` and 868 MHz = `868.35MHz`*

*If you see no frequency after protocol name, that means we don't know it, let us know in issues tab!*

*`AM650`, `FM`, `FSK476` - means modulation to use when reading the remote* 

*`FM` means you should try any existing FM modulations, `FSK???` means `FM???` in SubGHz - Read - Config*

## KeeLoq Rolling Code Supported Manufacturers list

KeeLoq is a rolling code encryption system used by many garage door openers and gate systems. 
The following manufacturers have KeeLoq support in RM firmware (thanks to Unleashed):

*Default value for encryption type "learning" is `simple` and `10bits` for serial part in Hop*

*In case if remote uses other serial bits or different encryption type and it was verified - it will be stated in the end*

## Protocol Type Reference

RM firmware supports various protocol types:

- **Static Code**: Fixed transmission codes (e.g., Roger, Princeton, Marantec, Revers RB2)
- **Rolling Code (Dynamic) (KeeLoq)**: Dynamic codes with rolling counter using KeeLoq encryption (60+ manufacturer systems supported)
- **Rolling Code (Dynamic)**: Other dynamic systems with custom encoding (e.g., CAME Atomo, Nice Flor S, Somfy Telis, FAAC SLH, Alutech AT-4N, Security+)

For more information on how to use some of these protocols, see also [SubGHzRemoteProg.md](/documentation/SubGHzRemoteProg.md) and the main [ReadMe.md](/ReadMe.md).
