This pin is Flipper RX on LPUART [Low Power UART] (so connect to TX on device).

For I2C devices this is SCL (Serial Clock) pin.

For ADC devices this is ADC1.1 pin (flipperscope application uses LL library to show values.)

Generic GPIO uses PC0.

CHECK: "LPTIM1.IN LPTIM2.IN"

Devices:
- BME280[I2C] (SCL)
- BH1750[I2C] (SCL)
