DANGER: Connect external modules with large capacitive load only when Flipper Zero is powered off. Otherwise, data on the microSD card can be corrupted.

This pin is 3.3 Volts output.  NOTE: Some people recommend using the 5V pin (L1) and a 3.3 volt regulator with output having a parallel 10uF and 100nF capacitor; so that voltage is more stable.

Max of 1200 mA (3.96 watt).

Look at device datasheet.  If 3.3 volts, connect to "VIN", "VCC", "3.3V/3V3" (if NO VIN) on the device.
