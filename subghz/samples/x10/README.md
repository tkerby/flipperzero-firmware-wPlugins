NOTE: As an Amazon Affiliate I (CodeAllNight) may earn from qualifying purchases from the amzn.to links below. 

The signals were captured from the "X10 Camera Control System Remote Control Model CR12A" which you can purchase from https://amzn.to/3issZPs and should also be compatible with signals from https://amzn.to/3QEF7cM (but the timing may be slightly different).

The receiver I used is no longer for sale, but a similar module can be purchased from https://amzn.to/3CFWy6M
