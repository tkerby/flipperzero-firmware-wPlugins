# Chevy HHR 2006 Remote

## Device
These Flipper Zero subghz captures are from the remote control for my Chevy HHR 2006 vehicle.  This remote operates at 3151MHz.  The remote has 3 buttons, but I only captured the lock and unlock codes.  The order of the button presses are the number of the file (so I did lock, unlock, lock, lock, etc.)


## Notes
The remote is using a rolling code scheme.  My goal is not to decode the rolling code, but rather to detect when the vehicle is locked and unlocked.

I haven't spent any time looking at the raw files yet.
