# FlipperZero_NFC_Comparator
This is a simple tool to compare a stored NFC card against a physical card using a Flipper Zero device as of the moment it just checks the UID and protocol but i would like to add support for checking more variables to confirm how similar the NFC cards are.
## Feedback:
Any feedback is welcome and would be very much appreciated as this is my first C project
