## VGM-Library
Collection of files for the Video Game Module. 
### Engine
The VGM Engine is not affiliated with Flipper Devices and utilizes the [PicoDVI](https://github.com/Wren6991/PicoDVI) and [pico-game-engine](https://github.com/jblanked/pico-game-engine) libraries. Developers can create their own games or recreate their Flipper games with the advantages of increased memory, colorful graphics, and video output to their TV or monitor.
### Screensavers
The current screensavers are compiled examples from the [PicoDVI-Adafruit Fork](https://learn.adafruit.com/picodvi-arduino-library-video-out-for-rp2040-boards/screensavers), edited and adapted for the Video Game Module.
