## Requirements

NFC files must:

- be Mifare Classic 1k
- have complete data
- have the correct sector 0 Key A

## How to use

- Be sure you don't have qFlipper or lab.flipper.net connected to the flipper when you launch (this will cause the USB emulation to fail to start).
- Use 'Load figure' to select a .nfc file to load
- Figure, if loaded successfully, will appear in list
- Press center when figure highlighted to remove (and save updated data to disk)
- Figures are not saved to disk except on unload, so be sure to save before quitting app
