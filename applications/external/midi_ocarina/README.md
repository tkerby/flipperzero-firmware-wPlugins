# Flipper_Zero_MIDI_Ocarina
push button to play midi note.
I made this to check if the MIDI library TX works.
It works perfectly. That's all.

This application is not fun to play around with TOTALLY. 

Guaranteed.

# Requirements

Python and ufbt.

```
pip install ufbt
```

Basically, just go to the directory, set up ufbt, and type 

```
ufbt

or

ufbt launch

```

For more information, please see Flipper Zero's FAP build instructions.
It is very detailed.

If you see me in a chat room somewhere, feel free to throw me about $3.
Of course, you can also give me the middle finger.

Builds were checked with v50.1 to v54.0 SDK
