## To use:

eMTRD are secured to prevent people from reading the data on a passport just by bumping into it.  The data is secured using a key based on the passport number, date of birth, and date of expiry.  A real passport machine reads these values from the MRZ (Machine Readable Zone, the ones with ">") using a camera. For the app, you have to enter the values manually.  The app will then generate the key and read the data using a system called BAC(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_control).

## Notes:
 - Caches MRZ info to make subsequent use faster

## Limitations
 - Does not parse some of the optional DG (under 'advanced' menu)

## To do
 - Support more countries passports
