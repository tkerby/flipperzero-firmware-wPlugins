# Flipper SPI Terminal

SPI TERMINAL is a SPI App, which allows you to control external devices using SPI. Your Flipper can act as a SPI Master or Slave device. The Slave mode allows you to sniff the communication between different SPI peripherals.

The App uses the Low-Level SPI Interface of the STM32WB55RG Microprocessor. All data is transmitted with DMA Sub-module and can reach speeds of up to 32 Mbit/s in Master and up to 24 Mbit/s in Slave mode.

It contains a rich [Inbuilt Documentation](https://github.com/janwiesemann/flipper-spi-terminal/blob/master/README.MD#inbuilt-documentation).
