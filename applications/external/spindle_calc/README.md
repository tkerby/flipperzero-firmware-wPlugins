## What it does

Given a length and spindle size, it calculates:
- How many spindles fit while keeping gaps within the **99 mm building regulation limit**
- The exact gap between each spindle
- Centre-to-centre spacing

There are two modes:

### Stair mode
Enter the **diagonal (rake) length** between posts and the **stair angle**. The app converts the diagonal to a horizontal run using `horiz = diagonal × cos(angle)`, then calculates all spacings from that. Results include both the horizontal gap and the rake length.

The built-in accelerometer can read the stair angle automatically — just lay the Flipper flat on a tread and press OK.

### Straight run mode
Enter the total **horizontal length** between posts. The app calculates count and spacing directly.

## Building

Requires the [Flipper Zero firmware SDK](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware) or [uFBT](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt).

```bash
# Using uFBT (recommended)
ufbt

# Deploy directly to connected Flipper
ufbt launch
```

## Installing from the catalog

1. Open the **Flipper Mobile App** or go to [lab.flipper.net](https://lab.flipper.net)
2. Browse to **Apps → Tools → Spindle Calculator**
3. Tap **Install**

## Building regulation note

This app enforces the **99 mm maximum gap** between spindles as required by UK Building Regulations Approved Document K (and equivalent standards). Always verify final measurements on site.
