# Arduventure

A top-down action RPG ported to Flipper Zero. The game features four distinct locations, boss fights, random encounters, and a progression system with inventory management and equipment upgrades.

This project is a [port](https://github.com/apfxtech/FlipperArduventure.git) of the original [game](https://github.com/Team-ARG-Museum/ID-46-Arduventure.git) project. The main goal of this fork is to port the game from the Arduboy console to **Flipper Zero**.
