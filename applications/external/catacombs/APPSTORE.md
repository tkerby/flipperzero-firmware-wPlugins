# Catacombs of the damned!

**Catacombs of the damned!** is a first-person shooter / dungeon crawler for the miniature [Arduboy game system](https://www.arduboy.com), where you explore 10 floors of a randomly generated dungeon, destroy monsters with magical fireballs, and collect as much loot as possible. This project is a **fork** of the original [Arduboy3D](https://github.com/jhhoward/Arduboy3D) project. The main goal of this fork is to port the game from the Arduboy console to **Flipper Zero**.
