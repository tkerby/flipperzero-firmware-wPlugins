# Flipper Zero Reaction Game

This is a simple reaction game for the Flipper Zero device. The game is designed to test your reaction times, giving you immediate feedback on how quickly you respond to visual prompts.

## Gameplay

- The game begins with a "Press to start" screen. Press any button to proceed.
- The screen then displays "Get ready..." as it prepares for the next stage.
- Without warning, the screen will display "PRESS", accompanied by a blue LED flash and a single vibro sequence.
- Your task is to press any button as quickly as possible once you see the "PRESS" prompt.
- If you react too early, before the "PRESS" prompt appears, you lose the game, indicated by a red LED flash and a vibro sequence. You'll also see a "Too soon!" message on the screen.
- Once you've reacted to the "PRESS" prompt, the game will display your reaction time in milliseconds.
