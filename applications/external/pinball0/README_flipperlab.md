# Pinball0 (Pinball Zero)
Play pinball on your Flipperzero!

## Features
* Realistic physics and collisions
* User-defined tables via JSON files
* Bumpers, flat surfaces, curved surfaces
* Table bumps (Don't tilt the table!)
* Portals!
* Rollover items, Turbo boosts
* Sounds! Blinky lights! Annoying vibrations!
* Customizable notification settings: sound, LED, vibration
* Idle timeout

## Controls
* **Ok** to release the ball
* **Left** and **Right** to activate the left and right flippers
* **Back** to return to the main menu or exit
* **Up** to "bump" the table if the ball gets stuck

I find it easiest to hold the flipper with both hands so I can hit left/right with my thumbs!

## Tables
Pinball0 ships with several default tables. These tables are automatically deployed into the assets folder (/apps_assets/pinball0/tables). Tables are simple JSON which means you can define your own! Your tables should be stored in the data folder (/apps_data/pinball0/tables). 

View the github repo for the JSON format specification: https://github.com/rdefeo/pinball0

**The default tables may change over time.**
