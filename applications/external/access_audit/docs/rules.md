# Audit Rules

Each rule maps to a named finding in saved reports. Rules are additive; multiple rules can fire on the same observation. The final score is clamped to 0-100.

## High-risk rules

### `legacy_family`

Triggers for credential families that lack effective cryptographic protection.

Matches:
- All 125 kHz RFID protocols (EM4100-like, HID Prox, HID Generic, Indala, generic 125 kHz), no crypto at all
- MIFARE Classic (1K, 4K, Mini), Crypto1 cipher is practically broken
- MIFARE Plus SL1, Classic-compatibility mode; AES is not active
- HID iCLASS Legacy (all memory variants: 2k, 16k, 32k), DES/3DES, master key publicly known

**Score contribution:** +35 · **Max severity:** HIGH

---

### `identifier_only_pattern`

Triggers when a UID is present with no evidence of protected application memory, and classification metadata is complete. The card's security relies on the UID alone; it can be cloned without breaking any crypto.

Signals:
- `uid_present` = true
- `user_memory_present` = false
- `metadata_complete` = true

Does not fire when `metadata_complete` is false; use `uid_no_memory` for incomplete observations.

**Score contribution:** +35 · **Max severity:** HIGH

---

## Medium-risk rules

### `uid_no_memory`

Weaker form of `identifier_only_pattern`. A UID is present but no evidence of authenticated/protected memory has been observed, and metadata is incomplete so a confident conclusion cannot be drawn. Does not fire when `identifier_only_pattern` already applies.

Signals:
- `uid_present` = true
- `user_memory_present` = false
- `metadata_complete` = false (or `identifier_only_pattern` did not fire for another reason)

**Score contribution:** +20 · **Max severity:** MEDIUM

---

## Low-risk / confidence rules

### `incomplete_evidence`

Classification metadata is incomplete; the poller could not read all expected fields. The result should be treated with caution.

**Score contribution:** +10 · **Confidence penalty:** -20%

---

### `no_uid`

UID could not be extracted. The observation cannot be fully assessed.

**Score contribution:** +10 · **Confidence penalty:** -15%

---

## Active scan findings

### `default_keys`

Fires when sector 0 on a MIFARE Classic card was authenticated using a well-known default key. Indicates the card keys have never been changed from factory defaults.

Keys checked (key A and key B for each):
- `FFFFFFFFFFFF` - factory default for all sectors on a new card
- `A0A1A2A3A4A5` - common key A default in NXP reference deployments

This rule requires an active authentication attempt. A note is written to the report indicating the finding came from an active scan.

**Score contribution:** +15 · **Max severity:** HIGH

---

## Mitigating rules

### `crypto1_breakable`

MIFARE Classic card. Crypto1 is cryptographically broken, but exploiting it still requires an active attack (dictionary scan or hardnested / darkside attack) against a reader. This is meaningfully more effort than cloning a 125 kHz EM4100 card, which is a passive serial-number replay with no cryptographic barrier at all. Applies a small score reduction relative to 125 kHz RFID cards.

Matches:
- MIFARE Classic 1K, 4K, Mini

**Score contribution:** -10

Does not apply to MIFARE Plus SL1 (Classic-compatible mode, same threat model as EM4100 for relay purposes once the SL1 downgrade is exploited).

---

### `modern_crypto`

Card family uses modern cryptography. Reduces the effective risk score and lowers the severity label.

Matches:
- MIFARE DESFire (all variants: EV1, EV2, EV3, Light), DES/3DES or AES
- MIFARE Plus SL2, AES crypto active (Classic-format frames)
- MIFARE Plus SL3, AES crypto + ISO14443-4 protocol
- FeliCa Standard, proprietary crypto (FeliCa Lite is excluded, no mutual auth)

**Score contribution:** -20

**Severity downgrade** (applies only when `legacy_family` did not also fire):
- HIGH → MEDIUM
- MEDIUM → SECURE when the resulting score reaches zero

## Scoring thresholds

| Label | Score range | Typical cause |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH RISK | 35-100 | `legacy_family` or `identifier_only_pattern` fired |
| MODERATE | 20-34 | `uid_no_memory` fired without modern crypto mitigation |
| LOW RISK | 10-19 | `incomplete_evidence` or `no_uid` only |
| SECURE | 0-9 | Modern crypto family with no other risk factors |

---

## Rule interaction examples

| Card | Rules fired | Score | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| EM4100 | legacy_family, identifier_only_pattern | 70 | HIGH RISK |
| MIFARE Classic 1K | legacy_family, identifier_only_pattern, crypto1_breakable | 60 | HIGH RISK |
| MIFARE Classic 1K (default keys) | legacy_family, identifier_only_pattern, default_keys, crypto1_breakable | 65 | HIGH RISK |
| MIFARE Plus SL1 | legacy_family, identifier_only_pattern | 70 | HIGH RISK |
| HID iCLASS Legacy 2k | legacy_family, identifier_only_pattern | 70 | HIGH RISK |
| MIFARE Plus SL2 | identifier_only_pattern, modern_crypto | 15 | MODERATE |
| MIFARE Plus SL3 | modern_crypto | 0 | SECURE |
| DESFire EV2/EV3 | modern_crypto | 0 | SECURE |
| DESFire EV1 | modern_crypto | 0 | SECURE |
| NTAG213 | identifier_only_pattern | 35 | HIGH RISK |
| Unknown card | incomplete_evidence, no_uid | 20 | MODERATE |

> **Note on the examples table:** scores shown assume `metadata_complete=true`. If the poller returned incomplete metadata, `incomplete_evidence` fires (+10, -20% confidence) and `identifier_only_pattern` is replaced by `uid_no_memory` (+20) since `metadata_complete=false`.
