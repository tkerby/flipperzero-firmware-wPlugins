A Flipper Zero app for **defensive auditing of NFC and RFID access-control credentials**.

Tap a card, get an instant risk score and plain-English advice. Save a named session report to SD.

> **Authorized use only.** This tool is intended for security professionals, system owners, and researchers assessing systems they own or are permitted to test.

## Features

- **Deep card classification**: MIFARE Classic 1K/4K/Mini, DESFire EV1/EV2/EV3/Light, MIFARE Plus SL1/SL2/SL3, Ultralight C, NTAG203/213/215/216, NTAG I2C, ISO14443-A/B, ISO15693, FeliCa (Standard/Lite), SLIX, ST25TB; 125 kHz RFID: EM4100, HID H10301, HID Generic, Indala; HID iCLASS (Legacy) 2k/16k/32k
- **Instant risk score**: 0-100 score with HIGH RISK / MODERATE / LOW RISK / SECURE label
- **Per-card advice**: plain-English recommendation written to every report entry
- **Multi-scan sessions**: scan up to 20 cards per session; live `[N]` counter visible on both scan and result screens
- **Named sessions**: optionally label a session before saving using an on-screen QWERTY keyboard
- **SD card reports**: timestamped `.txt` report saved to `/ext/apps_data/access_audit/` with per-card UID, SAK/ATQA, advice, and session-level advisory
- **On-device report viewer**: browse, scroll, and delete saved reports without leaving the app
- **NFC + RFID + iCLASS**: Left/Right cycles between 13.56 MHz NFC, 125 kHz RFID, and HID iCLASS scanning

## Installation

### Option 1: qFlipper (recommended)

1. Download `access_audit.fap` from the [latest release](https://github.com/matthewkayne/flipper-access-audit/releases/latest)
2. Open [qFlipper](https://flipperzero.one/update) and connect your Flipper via USB
3. Click the **File manager** tab
4. Navigate to `SD Card → apps → Tools`
5. Drag and drop `access_audit.fap` into that folder
6. On your Flipper: **Apps → Tools → Access Audit**

### Option 2: USB mass storage

1. Download `access_audit.fap` from the [latest release](https://github.com/matthewkayne/flipper-access-audit/releases/latest)
2. On your Flipper: **Settings → Storage → Unmount SD card**, which exposes the SD card as a USB drive
3. Copy `access_audit.fap` to the `apps/Tools/` folder on the drive
4. Eject the drive, then on your Flipper: **Apps → Tools → Access Audit**

### Option 3: SD card reader

1. Download `access_audit.fap` from the [latest release](https://github.com/matthewkayne/flipper-access-audit/releases/latest)
2. Remove the SD card from your Flipper and insert it into a card reader
3. Copy `access_audit.fap` to the `apps/Tools/` folder on the card (create the folder if it doesn't exist)
4. Reinsert the SD card and launch from **Apps → Tools → Access Audit**

### Build from source

Requires [uFBT](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt).

```sh
ufbt
# FAP is written to dist/access_audit.fap
# Then follow any option above to copy it to your Flipper
```

## Usage

| Screen | Controls |
|---|---|
| Scan | Tap/hold card · **Left/Right** cycle NFC → RFID → iCLASS · **Up** view reports · **Back** exit |
| Result | **OK** rescan · **Back** save session and proceed to naming |
| Name session | QWERTY keyboard · **OK key** save with name · **Back** skip naming / backspace |
| Reports list | **Up/Down** scroll · **OK** open · **Back** return to scan |
| Report viewer | **Up/Down** scroll lines · **Back** return to list · **Hold Back** delete report |

### Score interpretation

| Label | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH RISK | 35-100 | Legacy family (MIFARE Classic, EM4100, HID iCLASS, Plus SL1) or static-replay pattern |
| MODERATE | 20-34 | Risk indicators present; review recommended |
| LOW RISK | 10-19 | Minor concerns, e.g. incomplete metadata |
| SECURE | 0-9 | Modern crypto family with no major findings |

### Card classification depth

| Family | Sub-types detected |
|---|---|
| MIFARE Classic | 1K · 4K · Mini (via SAK byte) |
| MIFARE DESFire | EV1 · EV2 · EV3 · Light (via GetVersion) |
| MIFARE Plus | SL1 · SL2 · SL3 (via security level response) |
| MIFARE Ultralight / NTAG | Ultralight C · NTAG203/213/215/216 · NTAG I2C |
| HID iCLASS | Legacy 2k · Legacy 16k · Legacy 32k (via ACTALL/IDENTIFY/READ block 1) |
| 125 kHz RFID | EM4100 · HID H10301 · HID Generic · Indala · generic 125 kHz |

## How it works

1. The NFC scanner detects which protocols the card supports.
2. The richest available poller is started (DESFire → Plus → Ultralight → ISO14443-3a).
3. The poller reads the UID and card-specific metadata without authentication; no sectors are unlocked, no data is modified.
4. For HID iCLASS, a proprietary ACTALL → IDENTIFY → SELECT → READ block 1 exchange runs over the ISO15693 RF channel to obtain the CSN and memory variant.
5. The observation is scored against eight named rules (see [docs/rules.md](docs/rules.md)).
6. Results are displayed on screen and appended to the session buffer.
7. On save, the session is written as a `.txt` report with per-card advice and a session-level advisory.
