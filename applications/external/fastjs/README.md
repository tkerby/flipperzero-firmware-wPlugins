## Flipper Zero Application to Execute JavaScript Files Quickly

FastJS is a user-friendly application designed for the Flipper Zero that allows users to pre-save and quickly execute their favorite JavaScript files. It streamlines the process of running scripts, enhancing your Flipper Zero experience.
