## Development setup

- Buy a [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one) device
- Install [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) (=micro Flipper Build Tool)
- Connect to your Flipper device with USB cable and run `ufbt launch` in the repository directory to upload and run the project in the device

_Buying yourself a [developer board](https://shop.flipperzero.one/products/wifi-devboard) is highly recommended. But I wrote this project without one, so I guess it's possible to develop even without debugger, it's just more tedious..._
