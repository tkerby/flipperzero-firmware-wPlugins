# User documentation
This page describes how to interact with the game
and how the state progresses.

## Settings
In the settings menu it's possible to re-initialize
the game. All progresses will be lost.

It is also possile to enable or disable the vibration
and the sound.

In the settings you can also find the "about" screen.

## Features
### Experience
The Experience (XP) increases periodically. It
represents the evolution of the pet and it brings
him from the Egg stage until the Adult stage and
ending with the death due to the old age.

Every stage has a maximum amount of XP that are
required to pass to the next stage. The egg only
has 1XP, because the only goal for this stage
is to start the game.

The pet may get a new XP every few minutes.
The probability to get it it's not 100%, so
it may require multiple cycles to get one.

### Hunger
The Hunger (HU) is the indication of how
well fed is the pet. 100/100 means he's full, 0/100
means he's very hungry.

You can feed the pet by giving him a candy. Each
candy restores a variable number of HU. Once the
pet is full, he won't accept candies anymore.

When the HU indicator goes to 0, the pet will start
losing health (see below).

### Health
The Health (HP) indicator represents the health of the
pet in a scale from 0 to 100. 100 means healthy and 0
means dying.

The pet can lose HP in two ways: for starvation, when the
HU indicator is 0, or a cause of an illness.

The health is checked periodically. It will for sure lose
some HPs at every check if the HU indicator is 0. It's
random whether some HPs are lost for an illness.

You can restore the health by giving the pet a pill.
