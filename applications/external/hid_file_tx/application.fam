    fap_description="This is an application for the Flipper Zero that allows to exchange files using the HID protocol with around 260kB/s. This approach is especially useful when access to mass storage devices is blocked on a PC. Transferring files with this application requires the Windows/Linux client to run an executable that communicates with the Flipper Zero for data exchange. Therefore, multiple stages are required to be able to exchange data.",
