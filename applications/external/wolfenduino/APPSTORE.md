# Wolfenduino

Wolfenduino is a demake of id Software's *Wolfenstein 3D* originally created for the Arduboy FX and ported to Flipper Zero.

The game recreates the classic shareware episode "Escape from Wolfenstein" with original-style gameplay adapted for portable hardware.

## Features

- 10 levels based on the shareware episode "Escape from Wolfenstein"
- Enemies, weapons, and secret push-walls based on the original game
- Four difficulty levels
- Auto-save system that saves progress at the end of each level
- High score table

## Assets

An external assets file is required for normal gameplay.

Download the assets file here:  
[fxdata.bin](https://github.com/apfxtech/FlipperWolfenstein/raw/refs/heads/main/package/fxdata.bin)

After downloading, copy the file to the following path on your Flipper Zero:

/ext/apps_data/wolf/fxdata.bin

All other required files will be generated automatically on first launch.

## Custom Content

Wolfenduino supports custom assets. You can create and use your own:
- Maps

This allows full modification of levels, visuals, and sound.
