Wolfenduino is a demake of id software's Wolfenstein 3D for the Arduboy FX. 

The game recreates the classic shareware episode "Escape from Wolfenstein" with original-style gameplay adapted for portable hardware.

This project is a [port](https://github.com/apfxtech/FlipperWolfenstein.git) of the original [WolfenduinoFX](https://github.com/jhhoward/WolfenduinoFX.git) project. The main goal of this fork is to port the game from the Arduboy console to **Flipper Zero**.
