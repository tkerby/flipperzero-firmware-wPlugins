In this classic puzzle game, your objective is to connect all lamps to a single power source
using wires located between them.

You have a rectangular field of elements and your task is to turn each of them so wires connect lamps
to the power source.

The game ends when all the wires are used and deliver power to all lamps.
Controls are intuitive. Use long press Ok to change default rotation direction.
