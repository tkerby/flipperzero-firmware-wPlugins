# Flipper Seos

Flipper app for reading and emulating Seos-compatible cards/fobs/mobile credentials.

![Demo Video](demo.mp4)

## Keys

**The app uses all 00 keys by default.**  It uses an ADF OID of 030107090000000000 ("0.3.1.7.9.0.0.0.0.0").
If you'd like to use your own keys/ADF OID, use the format of the `keys-example.txt` to specify them, and place into `SD Card/apps_data/seos/keys.txt`

## To do:

- Fix iso14443a-4 framing
- ASN.1 for serializing/deserializing
- Support for larger message wrapping/unwrapping
- When parsing incoming data, use buffer + len instead of BitBuffer so I can increment buffer pointer as I parse header(s)
- CMAC checking where I missed it

## Hardware for BLE support (experimental)

1. Install/setup nordic SDK
1. Install Toolchain manager
1. Launch Toolchain manager
1. Next to SDK version click down arroy and "open terminal"
1. navigate to `samples/bluetooth/hci_uart_3wire`

### nRF52840

1. Edit `boards/nrf52840dk_nrf52840.overlay` and change current-speed to 460800 to match Flipper app.

1. `west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p auto`
1. `west flash`

### nRF52840 dongle

1. Copy `boards/nrf52840dongle_nrf52840.overlay` to `hci_uart_3wire`
1. Might need to: `nrfutil install nrf5sdk-tools`
1. `west build -b nrf52840dongle_nrf52840 -p auto`
1. `nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools pkg generate --hw-version 52 --sd-req=0x00  --application ./build/hci_uart_3wire/zephyr/zephyr.hex --application-version 1 app.zip`
1. Put dongle into DFU by pressing 'reset' button
1. `nrfutil nrf5sdk-tools dfu usb-serial -pkg app.zip -p /dev/cu.usbmodemD39BF26162261`
