Yes, a calculator or your phone could probably do this much faster, but it seemed like a good first app
to write on my own from scratch!

Since the F0 original firmware doesn't include an option to enter a decimal point, the app allows the
user to use a "\_" character instead.

To reset the calculator, just change a value to solve for to zero, or exit and re-enter. I will add
a reset/clear option when I get to it.

Special thanks to Derek Jamison for his F0 tutorials https://github.com/jamisonderek and everyone
else out there who spread their knowledge and time for others.
