The Flipper Pomodoro app helps you to organize your work using the time management technique called Pomodoro. The method helps you to switch between work and rest in 25-minute intervals.

Run the app and choose from three modes:

- Classic: work for 25 minutes, have rest for 5 minutes.
- Long: work for 50 minutes, have rest for 10 minutes.
- Sprint: work for 10 minutes, have rest for 2 minutes.
