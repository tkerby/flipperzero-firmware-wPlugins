# Polynomial-Solver
Polynomial-Solver is an application for the Flipper Zero that enables users to solve and manipulate polynomials up to the sixth degree. With this app, you can evaluate polynomials, calculate derivatives and integrals, and visualize results directly on the Flipper's screen.
Enter coefficients for a polynomial of up to the sixth degree and calculate its value for any given 洧논.

Derivative Calculation: Compute the derivative of the polynomial, reducing its degree.

Integration: Calculate the integral of the polynomial, increasing its degree (up to a maximum limit).

Scrollable Results: View long polynomial equations by scrolling horizontally.

Intuitive Navigation: Use the Flipper's directional buttons to navigate menus and input data.


How It Works

Set Polynomial Coefficients: Input coefficients for each term of the polynomial, starting from 洧논^0 (constant term) up to 洧논^洧녵 (highest degree term). Adjust coefficients using UP and DOWN buttons.

View Polynomial: Once coefficients are set, the app displays the complete polynomial equation.

Scroll left or right to view long equations.

Evaluate Polynomial: The app calculates the polynomial's value at a predefined 洧논 value and displays the result.

Derivative and Integral: Use UP in the calculus mode to calculate the derivative. Use DOWN in the calculus mode to calculate the integral (if within the maximum degree limit).
