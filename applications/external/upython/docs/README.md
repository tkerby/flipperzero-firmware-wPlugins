# MicroPython

MicroPython is a version of the popular Python programming language, especially tailored for the hardware requirements of small microcontrollers, like the Flipper Zero.
Instead of supporting the full standard library, only a subset is implemented, carefully selected with the requirements of a microcontroller environment in mind.
But this should not limit your creativity and ability to create great applications at all.

## Disclaimer

Running MicroPython is a heavy task for the Flipper.
This does sometimes lead to an _Out of Memory_ error.
**This doesn't harm your Flipper.**
