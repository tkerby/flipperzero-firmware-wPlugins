# Flipper Zero Orgasmotron Update

## What this is?
This app is a proof-of-concept to show abilities of the vibration motor in the Flipper Zero device. I'm also using this <br>
to learn how to code for Flipper Zero
<br><br>
By default the Flipper Zero firmware framework offers very limited use of the vibration motor<br>
- Turn on<br>
- Turn off<br>
<br>
The Goal of this application is to show further potential of the motor, by changing it's vibration pattern using pauses. <br>
<br>

## What this does
The application allows you to play different vibration patterns. 

## How to install on Flipper Zero
- If you do not have one, download a firmware<br>
- Plug your Flipper Zero in via USB. <br>
- Copy the contents of this folder into the applications_user folder of your firmware. <br> 

Then run the command: 
 ```
.\fbt launch_app APPSRC=applications_user/orgasmatron
 ```
The application will be compiled and copied onto your device.
