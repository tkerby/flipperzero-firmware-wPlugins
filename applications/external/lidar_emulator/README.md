# LIDAR Emulator
This app can be used to emulate infrared signals of different LIDARs.

## Instructions

Enter the submenu and a LIDAR gun then press and hold OK button to transmit.
It will transmit until you hold the OK button. Blue LED lights during the transmit.

Use back to exit.

## What good is this?

You can use it to test a LIDAR jammer responsiveness for different signals.
It is unable to jam police LIDARs.

## Limitations

The shortest pulse width can be emitted with internal infrared emitters is around 2 us,
but real LIDAR guns are emitting 10-30 ns wide pulses.
