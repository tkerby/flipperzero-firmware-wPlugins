# INA Meter for Flipper Zero

INA Meter is an application for Flipper Zero that allows you to read I2C-connected current/power monitors from Texas Instruments.

## Supported Sensors:

- **INA219** – 0–26V, 16-bit resolution (±0.5% accuracy)
- **INA226** – 0–36V, 16-bit resolution (±0.1% accuracy)
- **INA228** – 0–85V, 20-bit resolution (±0.05% accuracy)

## Wiring

| Flipper pin  | INAxxx |
| ------------ | ------ |
| C0 (16)      | SCL    |
| C1 (15)      | SDA    |

## Instructions for Use:

- Launch the application and go to the configuration menu by pressing the LEFT button.
- Select the sensor type, configure its I2C address, and set the shunt resistance.
- Once the settings are complete, press the BACK button to return to the Current Gauge Screen.
- If the sensor is connected properly, the Current Gauge Screen will display the bus voltage and the current flowing through the shunt resistor.

## Precision and Sampling Presets

The application provides a simple way to configure conversion time and sample averaging with four preset levels: Low, Medium, High, and Max. These settings are sensor-specific:

|              | Low       | Medium   | High     |  Max   |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- | -------- |--------|
| INA219       | 532μs x 128    | 532μs x 128    | 532μs x 128  | 532us x 128  |
| INA226       | 140μs x 1024    | 588μs x 1024  | 2116μs x 1024  | 8244us x 1024 |
| INA228       | 50μs x 1024    | 280μs x 1024  | 1052μs x 1024  | 4120us x 1024 |

The precision can be set independently for VBUS and shunt voltage measurements.

## Measurement Range and Resolution

Each sensor operates within a fixed voltage range, with a defined resolution for both bus voltage (VBUS) and shunt voltage (VSHUNT) measurements. The values below indicate the maximum measurable voltage and the smallest detectable voltage step for each parameter.

|              | VBUS Max  | VBUS Resolution | VSHUNT Max | VSHUNT Resolution |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| INA219       | 26V       | 4mV       | ±320mV    | 10μV      |
| INA226       | 36V       | 1.25mV    | ±81.92mV  | 2.5μV     |
| INA228       | 85V       | 195.315μV | ±160mV    | 312.5nV   |
