# fz-schip
A SUPER-CHIP emulator for the Flipper Zero

## I know there's something wrong with it but i can't figure out what it is so the current state of this project is public testing. Please let me know if there are any issues with it.

## Installing
Just click the FAP badge in the title.

## Uploading ROMs
Launch the app, and the folder /ext/apps_data/schip will be created. Then upload your .ch8 files to that folder and enjoy your emulator!
