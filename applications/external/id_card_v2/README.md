## ID_card_v2
This program represents a simple application for managing an ID card for Flipper Zero.


# Application Description
The "ID Card v2" application allows users to easily manage personal data such as name, phone number, address, and notes. These data are stored in a text file (id.txt) on the device.

# How to Use the Application
Main Menu
In the main menu, users have three options:

ID Card: View personal data.
Setup: Input, view, and edit personal data.
About: Information about the application and the author.

# Inputting Personal Data
When selecting the "Setup" option, users enter their personal data in the format: step by step. If the user does not want to enter a specific piece of data, they can omit it, but it is important to retain the "0".

Viewing ID Card
After entering data, users can view their ID card. The application will display all entered data in the form of an ID card.

Saving Changes
All changes to personal data are automatically saved when the user finishes inputting or editing.

Note
If the user does not want to enter specific data such as a phone number or address, they can leave that field blank. In that case, it is necessary to leave "0", so that the application can interpret the format correctly.
