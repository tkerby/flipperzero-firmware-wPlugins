## 1.1
- Fix SL detection: probe actual security level via SAK and AuthFirstPart1 instead of defaulting to SL3
- SL1 cards now show card info but hide Dump with a hint to use the built-in NFC app for MF Classic

## 1.0
- Initial public release
- MIFARE Plus SL3 card detection and identification (UID, SAK, ATQA, ATS, manufacturer decoding, BCC validation)
- Full sector dump using a dictionary attack with both KeyA and KeyB recovery per sector
- Bundled default key dictionary (about 20 well-known MFP AES keys), users can add their own .dic files in /ext/apps_data/mfp_reader/
- Live visual scan progress with per-sector activity grid
- Per-sector dump result view (A-only / B-only / A+B / failed)
- Hex byte view of all dumped sectors with monospace font
- Save dumps as Version 2 .mfp files with editable file names and a duplicate-name validator
- Load saved dumps from the Saved menu
- Delete saved dumps from inside the app
- MIFARE Plus SL3 card emulation (AuthFirst, AuthNonFirst, ReadEncrypted, WriteEncrypted) with live counters and a sector activity grid view
- Two emulation modes per dump: Writable (changes persisted to file) or Read-only (changes discarded)
- Scan optimization: tracks the last successful KeyA and KeyB and tries them first on each new sector — most sectors auth in a single attempt
