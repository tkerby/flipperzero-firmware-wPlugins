# Gemini-Flipper

Currently in development stage, here I'm going to upload the .js code that I currently use so that anyone who wants to join and help improve it can make their PRs and also for those C developers who want to help create the native Flipper app and be accessible by everyone from https://lab.flipper.net/apps

~~Important: Now the javascript app works with the new firmware! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰~~

Important: Due to changes in the Flipper Zero firmware regarding the implementation of mJs and the changes it had, the .js application no longer works with the new versions of the firmware, but don't worry the native app in C is close to the end to be released so that everyone can enjoy it

## How it is work

Currently the code takes the api key in plain text stored in:

"/ext/apps_data/gemini_ia/key.txt" <-- You need to manually create it

(You can get the Gemini Api Key using this link: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key You only need a Gmail account)

it reads the .txt file and sends it via serial command to the esp32 as soon as the app is initialized (it would be nice to implement some kind of encryption to the api key but it is important that it is sent in plain text and unencrypted to the esp32 because this is how the firmware can read and implement it)

If you previously connected to a Wi-Fi network, it will automatically reconnect and you can continue chatting without having to reconnect to the Wi-Fi because it stores known networks and connects if you are close to one

I added the source code of the new firmware for the esp32 and also the pre-compile binary for ESP-Flasher app (You can find the binary in the relases section)

## How to flash the firmware using ESP-Flasher

Check the folder "Gemini IA Precompiled binaries" there is a tutorial on how to do it there

## TO DO

- [ ] Remove unnecessary files

- [x] Create a Dev branch to avoid conflicts with the Main branch

- [x] Rewrite javascript app for work with the new firmware

- [x] Javascript: Change the menu to only leave the option to "connect to a new AP" the "saved APs" option is obsolete, now the list of saved APs is sent in the background to the ESP32 after setting the name so that it detects if any of the networks is available and connects automatically, otherwise it will ask the user to enter the username and password of the AP to which they want to connect and will save the data of this new AP for the future

- [x] Rewrite the ESP32 firmware now should work with all the ESP32 models using ESP-TOOLS

- [x] improve the handling of how the APs are saved, currently it saves them but rewrites the previous one

- [x] improve the handling of how the saved APs are sent to the esp32 to avoid re-entering the SSID and password (Improving the previous point this should solve itself)

- [x] load the firmware binary for the esp32 (nothing to do here just load the binary)

## Native app

The native app is in development.  Currently it just shows the main menu and then each option shows "Under construction".

Changes: Now you can not only set your name and chat, but you can also change the name if you want. We still need to implement the function to connect to a new AP (currently it only connects to those already saved in "/ext/apps_data/gemini_ia/SavedAPs.txt"). Side note: I will make a small tutorial on how to use the app once everything is stable and ready for everyone to use.
