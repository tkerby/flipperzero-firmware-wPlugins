# Digimon F-Com

This application can be used to communicate with Digimon Virtual pets. You will need a small circuit between the Flipper Zero and the device in order for this to work as described [Here](https://github.com/TylerWilley/flipper-f-com)

You may also want to copy the digirom codes from that repository into your app_data/fcom directory on your Flipper so they are accessible on the device for convenience.
