**Game Design Document: "Morse Master" for Flipper Zero**
*Version 1.0 | Target Platform: Flipper Zero | Genre: Educational/Simulation*

---

### **1. Overview**

**Application Name**: Morse Master
**Target Audience**: Morse code learners, amateur radio enthusiasts, preppers.
**Core Objective**: Teach International Morse Code through gamified drills, leveraging Flipper Zero’s hardware for real-time encoding/decoding practice.
**Key Inspiration**: U.S. Navy training techniques, Koch-Farnsworth method, and apps like Morse Toad.

### **2. Core Mechanics**

#### **2.1 Learning Modes**

1. **Koch-Farnsworth Trainer**
    - **Progressive Character Introduction**: Starts with 2 characters (e.g., "E", "T"), adding new ones only after 90% accuracy.
    - **Speed Control**: Defaults to 20 WPM character speed with Farnsworth spacing (adjustable via settings).
    - **Adaptive Difficulty**: Automatically focuses on characters with the lowest accuracy.
2. **Real-Time Decode Practice**
    - **Receive Mode**: Flipper plays Morse via speaker/buzzer; user decodes and inputs answers via buttons.
    - **Send Mode**: User transmits Morse using button/GPIO key; Flipper displays decoded text.
3. **Missions (Gamified Challenges)**
    - **SOS Rescue**: Send SOS within 5 seconds, 100% accuracy.
    - **Weather Report**: Decode 10 simulated weather broadcasts.
    - **Stealth Comms**: Transmit a message using LED flashes only.

#### **2.2 Progression System**

- **XP Points**: Awarded for accuracy, speed, and mission completion.
- **Skill Tree**: Unlock features like radio transmission or custom waveforms as users progress.
- **Achievements**:
    - *Lightning Fingers*: Send 15 WPM for 1 minute.
    - *Eagle Ear*: Decode 50 characters with 95% accuracy.

### **3. Technical Specifications**

#### **3.1 Input/Output**

- **Primary Input**: Flipper’s directional button (short/long presses for dots/dashes).
- **GPIO Support**: External telegraph key/paddle via GPIO pins (for tactile learners).
- **Output**:
    - **Audio**: Buzzer with adjustable pitch (500–1500 Hz).
    - **Visual**: LED flashes (white for dots, blue for dashes).
    - **Display**: Real-time text feedback with error highlighting.


#### **3.2 Radio Integration**

- **Sub-1GHz Transmissions**: Encode messages to radio signals for real-world practice.
- **Signal Library**: Preloaded common phrases (e.g., "CQ", "MAYDAY").


#### **3.3 Performance Requirements**

- **Latency**: <50ms response time for button-to-audio feedback.
- **Battery Optimization**: LED-only mode for low-power practice.

### **4. Art \& Sound Design**

- **UI Style**: Minimalist monochrome, inspired by naval signal manuals.
- **Icons**:
    - Dot: Small circle (·)
    - Dash: Horizontal line (–)
- **Sound Design**:
    - Dot: 100ms beep at 800 Hz.
    - Dash: 300ms beep at 800 Hz.
    - Error: Quick 200 Hz buzz.

### **6. Metrics \& Validation**

- **Success Criteria**:
    - 80% of beta testers achieve 10 WPM within 30 days.
    - Average session length ≥8 minutes.
- **Analytics Tracking**:
    - WPM progression per user.
    - Most frequent error characters.

### **7. Example User Flow**

1. **Bootup**: Splash screen with Morse code "73" (ham radio "best regards").
2. **Main Menu**:
    - Learn | Practice | Missions | Settings
3. **Learning Session**:
    - Hears "E" (·) → Repeats via button → Earns XP.
4. **Mission "SOS Rescue"**:
    - Sends ··· −−− ··· → Unlables "Lifesaver" badge.

---

### **8. Risks \& Mitigation**

- **Risk**: Button latency during high-speed sending.
**Fix**: Interrupt-driven GPIO polling.
- **Risk**: Radio interference in urban areas.
**Fix**: Optional simulated transmission mode.
