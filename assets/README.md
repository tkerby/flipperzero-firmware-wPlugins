# FlipWorld

The first open-world multiplayer game for the Flipper Zero, best played with the VGM.

## Requirements
- WiFi Developer Board, Raspberry Pi, or ESP32 device with the FlipperHTTP flash: https://github.com/jblanked/FlipperHTTP
- 2.4 GHz WiFi access point

## How It Works
FlipWorld and FlipSocial are connected. Your login information is the same in both apps; if you register an account in either app, you can log in to both using that information. This also means that your friends, messages, and achievements are synced between apps. You only need a username and password to start, which is set in the User Settings. Keep in mind your username will be displayed to others, so choose wisely.

We've simplified the settings for easy use of the app. In the Game Settings, you can adjust the FPS (30, 60, 120, or 240), download World Packs, and select whether you want the screen backlight to always be on.

The controls in the game are straightforward. Press and hold left to go left, press and hold right to go right, etc. If you press the OK button, it will teleport you to the next available world. **Do NOT spam the OK button** as it could freeze your Flipper Zero. Press it once and wait for it to load.
