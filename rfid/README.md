The spreadsheet is support for the following videos:
- [T5577 overview](https://youtu.be/X6UJI4h9T5I)
- [T5577 user data](https://youtu.be/5DvIBvXBDX8)

This [lf-rfid excel file](lf-rfid.xlsx) has 4 tabs.

- EM4100 tab : Enter the HEX data in cell H1, like `1A:01:65:73:D1` and you will see all of the data along with the data needed to program a T5577 chip (block 0-2) will be displayed in cells J22-J24.

- H10301 tab : Enter the HEX data in cell H1, like `65:73:D1` and you will see all of the data along with the data needed to program a T5577 chip (block 0-3) will be displayed in cells J18-J21.

- AWID tab : Enter the HEX data in cell H1, like `1A:B2:B9:E8:C0` and you will see all of the data along with the data needed to program a T5577 chip (block 0-3) will be displayed in cells J22-J25.

- Card number tab : Enter the Facility code in cell B2 and the Card number in cell B3.  The H10301 Hex data for that facility/card will be in cell D22.  The EM4100 Hex data for that facility/card will be in cell D27.  The AWID Hex data for that facility/card will be in cell D35.

- Indala tab : Enter the Facility code inb cell B2 and the Card number in cell B5.  Copy E5-T5 into cell E6-T6.  The Indala26 Hex data for that facility/card will be in cell C24.  ** NOTE: AA18, AG18-AJ18 are currently set to 0, but may need to be set to another number?


The [Keri excel file](Keri.xlsx) is for a Keri encoded FC and Card number. Enter a FC (0-31) and a Card number (22-bits or less) and you will get the encoded HEX value to use with Keri. If your firmware doesn't support entering hex, you can create an RFID file (for example for FC:17, Card:1337 the HEX is 11117080):

```
Filetype: Flipper RFID key
Version: 1
Key type: Keri
Data: 11 11 70 80
```
