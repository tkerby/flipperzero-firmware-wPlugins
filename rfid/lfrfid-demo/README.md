# lfrfid-demo

## Overview
This is a console application, you need to look at https://lab.flipper.net/cli and run the `log debug` command to see the output from this application.

This is a sample project to demonstrate the use of the LFRFIDReader library. The library is used to read low-frequency (125kHz) RFID tags. When a tag is detected, the library will invoke your callback function with the tag's data. You can specify the callback function and the protocol of the RFID tag.
