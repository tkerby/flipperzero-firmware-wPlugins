## Overview
As I am creating tutorials, I will try to include links to either
the product that I bought previously, or a similar product if the
original product is no longer for sale (some of the parts I have are many years old).

If you are just starting out, I'd recommend ordering this starter kit...
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IyKacg) Great starter kit : Boardboard + jumper wires + some starter components (LEDs, resistors, pots, transistors, capacitors, switches, 74959 IC, CdS sensor, buzzers, etc.)

**NOTE:** I own many other kits with various sensors that we will also be utilizing in future videos.  I'll add links to those kits as I use them in my YouTube videos.


## Parts list
### Tools
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3kyRqM3) Inexpensive logic analyzer that runs on Windows and Linux machines.  I use PulseView for viewing and analyzing signals using this probe.  You do NEED to solder the probes.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4267wwm) This is the soldering station I use for my projects.  It's fairly expensive, so if you are on a budget you can get an iron for a lot cheaper -- something like [link](https://amzn.to/3IVu9x3) should work okay (but I don't personally own it).

### Breadboards
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IyKacg) Great starter kit : Boardboard + jumper wires + some starter components (LEDs, resistors, pots, transistors, capacitors, switches, 74959 IC, CdS sensor, buzzers, etc.)
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3lRGRUM) Large breadboard, very similar to the one in my videos.  Great for prototyping LARGE circuits.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IAEUoi) Variety of breadboards (2 with rails, 6 without) + jumper wires; very similar to other boards I own.

### Wires
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3lTbfOd) These are the jumper wires (Dupont Wire) I ordered.  They have male/male, male/female, female/female.  You can never have too many of these cables --  I also bought [link](https://amzn.to/3YXlob8) and [link](https://amzn.to/41cpJZL); all of which are very similar.  
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3xBuUVw) I also ordered these jumper wires, which came with some rotary encoders.  (In a future video, I'll use the encoders.)
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3KjRF8c) These are the aligator clips I bought to clip on to various connections.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3zEQmu2) Quick splice wires are very useful for making connections without cutting the wires.  I used these in my Wiegand video.


### Resistors
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3Igs0uB) A good assortment of resistors that I bought in the past.  They are 1% tolerance (which is really good).  
  - NOTE: If you never owned resistors before, you may **also** want to purchase something like [link](https://amzn.to/3xEphpS) because they have three color bands + tolerance band; which is fairly common in older electronics {so it's good to get familiar with the color codes} -- I own something similar, back from my RadioShack days, but it is not this exact same kit.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3Kk6nvJ) I love how easy it is to read the values on this decade box (and I own two of these) but they are expensive.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IeSHzw) This circuit board has variable resistors, moving the jumpers around is a little bit of a pain, but it's nice to be able to get a precise value vs. using a trimmer or potentiometer.

### LEDs
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3XNYLER) This is one of my main assortment of LEDs.
- [Amazon search result](https://amzn.to/3Ij0rkg) 7-Segment displays are available with "common cathode" and "common anode".  I bought mine from Vetco Electronics in Bellevue, WA, USA -- so I don't have an Amazon link to recommend.  For "common cathode" one pin goes to GND and the Flipper Zero GPIO output pins need to drive output to 3.3volts.  For "common anode" one pin goes to 3.3volts or 5.0volts and the Flipper Zero GPIO output pins need to drive output to GND.  Both configurations are possible; so either will work fine.  Most people like "common cathode" because then you write a GPIO 'true' to turn the LED on (instead of 'true' to turn it off.)

### Misc
-[Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3ZMzzQk) This is a 125KHz RFID reader with keypad.  The output is 4-bit Wiegand for the keypad and 26/34-bit Wiegand for the RFID reader.  I bought this to use in my Wiegand video. 

## Not-Disclaimer
Amazon has currently suspended by affilate commisions, so when you purchase through links on this page I will not earn an affiliate commission.  #nocommissionsearned
